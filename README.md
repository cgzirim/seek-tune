## Description üéº
SeekTune is an implementation of Shazam's song recognition algorithm based on insights from these [resources](#resources--card_file_box). It integrates Spotify and YouTube APIs to find and download songs.

[//]: # (## Current Limitations
While the algorithm works excellently in matching a song with its exact file, it doesn't always find the right match from a recording. However, this project is still a work in progress. I'm hopeful about making it work, but I could definitely use some help :slightly_smiling_face:.   
Additionally, it currently only supports song files in WAV format.
)

## Installation :desktop_computer:
### Prerequisites
- Golang: [Install Golang](https://golang.org/dl/)
- FFmpeg: [Install FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- NPM: To run the client (frontend).

### Steps
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/cgzirim/seek-tune.git
```
Install dependencies for the backend
```
cd seek-tune
go get ./...
```
Install dependencies for the client
```
cd seek-tune/client
npm install
```

## Docker üêã 

Should you choose to run as a docker container, the docker compose in the root of the project can be used run start the service with the command docker-compose up -d. With the first run, the image will be built using the Dockerfile also found in the root of the project. If you need to rebuild the image after the first run of docker compose, the image can be built with the docker build . command from the root of the project.

*Note: Only the features available in the app UI are available while running the docker container.*

## Usage :bicyclist:

#### ‚ñ∏ Start the Client App üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è 
```
# Assuming you're in the client directory:

npm start
```
#### ‚ñ∏ Start the Backend App üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
In a separate terminal window:
```
cd seek-tune
go run *.go serve [-proto <http|https> (default: http)] [-port <port number> (default: 5000)]
```
#### ‚ñ∏ Download a Song üì• 
Note: A link from Spotify's mobile app won't work. You can copy the link from either the desktop or web app.
```
go run *.go download <https://open.spotify.com/.../...>
```  
#### ‚ñ∏ Save local songs to DB (supports all audio formats) üóÉÔ∏è   
```
go run *.go save [-f|--force] <path_to_song_file_or_dir_of_songs>
```
The `-f` or `--force` flag allows saving the song even if a YouTube ID is not found. Note that the frontend will not display matches without a YouTube ID.  
  
#### ‚ñ∏ Find matches for a song/recording üîé
```
go run *.go find <path-to-wav-file>
```
#### ‚ñ∏ Delete fingerprints and songs üóëÔ∏è 
```
go run *.go erase
```

## Example :film_projector:

## Database Options üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
This application uses SQLite as the default database, but you can switch to MongoDB if preferred.   

#### Using MongoDB
1. [Install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)
2. Configure MongoDB Connection:  
   To connect to your MongoDB instance, set the following environment variables:

   * `DB_TYPE`: Set this to "mongo" to indicate using MongoDB.
   * `DB_USER`: The username for your MongoDB database.
   * `DB_PASS`: The password for your MongoDB database.
   * `DB_NAME`: The name of the MongoDB database you want to use.
   * `DB_HOST`: The hostname or IP address of your MongoDB server.
   * `DB_PORT`: The port number on which your MongoDB server is listening.

   **Note:** The database connection URI is constructed using the environment variables.  
   If the `DB_USER` or `DB_PASS` environment variables are not set, it defaults to connecting to `mongodb://localhost:27017`.
